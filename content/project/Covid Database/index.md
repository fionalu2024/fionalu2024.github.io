‚≠ê **Project Goal**

This project investigates and works with a publicly available dataset of A Global Database of COVID-19 Vaccinations. It asks to design a conceptual model for storing the COVID-19 dataset in a relational database, and developed SQL queries for data retrieval and visualization.

‚ùó **Challenges**

Based on the complexity of the dataset, there is a need to analyse and pre-process the dataset. And it is the real-world data, some of the values calculated based on the functional dependency might not be as same as the manually recorded data.

üí™ **Strategies**

While taking the 7 steps to Map the ER Model to a Relational Database Schema, I apply the normalisation techniques, as well as thinking of the way to apply functional dependency. After creating the database and importing data, I then develop SQL queries for data retrieval and visualization, facilitating data-driven decisions.
